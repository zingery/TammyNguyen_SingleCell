============
Location: Zoom, 1:30pm
Attendees: Silvia, Tammy, Benjamin, Tiffany, Anand, Shannon, Rachel, Zinger, Qin, Javi


### Discussion 
- CD34+ cells are ~1% of the total population and appeared spread out
- Potentially magnetically enrich CD34+ cells for bulk profiling.
- There are fewer strong BMR markers
- Velocity analysis ongoing (still aligning)


### Task
- [#11](https://github.com/zingery/TammyNguyen_SingleCell/issues/11) Velocity analysis of BMR and BMS
- Javi: singleR cell type analysis
- Javi: CD34+ THY1+ subpopulation analysis
